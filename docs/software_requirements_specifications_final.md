# Overview

This document is meant to establish the requirements of the final product. It goes into detail on what is needed for the Physics Engine, User Input, and Graphics Interface.

# Software Requirements

The first section of this document will be dedicated to Functional Requirements, while the second section will be dedicated to Non-Functional Requirements
  
  ## Functional Requirements
  
  ### Physics Engine Requirements

  | :-------------:| :----------: | 
  | FR1 | Shapes shall move with respect to a physics system implemented through a physics engine class and supporting values. | 
  | FR2 | Shapes shall conform to numerical constraints defined in the main class, and applied to all shapes, such as gravity and drag. | 
  | FR3 | Shapes shall have collisions with frame boundaries. | 
  | FR4 | The PhysicsEngine class shall run as a thread during program execution |
  | FR5 | The PhysicsEngine class shall use vector and acceleration classes in its calculations |
  
  ### User Input Requirements
  | ID | User Input | 
  | :-------------:| :----------: |
  | FR6 | Debug statistics shall be turned on or off via mouse click. | 
  | FR7 | Dancing figure shall be turned on or off via mouse click. | 
  | FR8 | Frame boundaries shall be changed with the mouse.  | 
  | FR9 | Program shall stop running when X button clicked via mouse. | 
  | FR10| The User shall be able to select options from a drop down menu at the top of the window |
  
  ### Graphics Interface Requirements
  | ID | Graphics Interface | 
  | :-------------:| :----------: |
  | FR11| Shapes shall be properly drawn through the use of the 2DGraphics library. | 
  | FR12| Shapes shall be drawn according to their type. | 
  | FR13| Dancing figure shall automatically loop through dance animations. | 
  | FR14| All Entities that need to be drawn shall be stored in an ArrayList | 
  | FR15| The main loop shall retrieve the user's mouse position and display its coordinates on screen |
  
  ## Non-Functional Requirements
  
  ### Physics Engine Requirements
  | ID | Physics Engine | 
  | :-------------:| :----------: | 
  | NFR1 | There shall be a physics simulation that the user can observe | 
  | NFR2 | Objects within the simulation shall be two-dimensional |
  | NFR3 | Object collision shall result in an updated position for the object. |
  | NFR4 | Shapes shall detect other shapes. |
