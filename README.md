# GUI Dancer

Our project is a graphical user interface whose funciton is to create a simple physics simulation environment in which the user can interact with. Through our simple physics engine we can simulate collisions between various shapes and boundaries. This includes accounting for gravity, drag coefficients, velocity, acceleration, and coordinate position. We originally set out to create a dancing stick figure interface through which the user could create dances and move the figure, however after investigating the idea further we decided that the physics engine behind such a system might be a better area to focus on. As an homage to our original goal, the graphical interface of our physics engine showcases a dancing stick figure in the background.

## Prerequisites

JDK 8
JRE 8
Your choice of IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

## Run Instructions

In order to run the program you must first download and install the most recent version of the Java Virtual Machine (or JVM) and any version of Java above Java 11. After installing, you can pick from your choice of IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.) and clone this repository into a project. After setting up each module (src, tests, out) you can build the project and run the main method. In order to customize variables within the simulation, you will need to change the config variable at the top of the Main class.
